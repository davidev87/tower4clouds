The MODAClouds Data Analyzer
===========

In the context of MODAClouds European project (www.modaclouds.eu), Politecnico was
one of the partners involved in the development of the QoS Analysis and Monitoring Tools.

The Data Analyzer (DA) is the component responsible of aggregating, analyzing and verifying
conditions on monitoring data.

The data analyzer is based on the open-source project rsp-services-csparql, available at [this link](https://github.com/streamreasoning/rsp-services-csparql).

Refer to the [Monitoring Platform Wiki](https://github.com/deib-polimi/modaclouds-monitoring-manager/wiki) for installation and usage of the whole platform.
